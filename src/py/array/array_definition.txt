    3. elements can be retrieved using index
    4. elements are stored in contiguous memory location
    5. array size should e declared at the time of creation itself.

DISADVANTAGES OF ARRAY:
    1. Fixed Size : Size of an array is static
    2. One Block Allocation: 
    3. Complex poition based Insertion : To insert an element at a given position , 
    we need to shift the existing elemnts.
